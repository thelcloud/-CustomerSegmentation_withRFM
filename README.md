**CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION with RFM**


![1_cRaMqS-cTQSvyXMAI12Dlw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58116973/126073954-fa449d13-72b3-41af-9d77-be2cf1d567d2.png)

**Recency**: It gives us how much time has passed between our customer's last shopping date and today. This time actually shows the customer's activity.
<br>
**Frequency**: It shows the amount of purchase our customer buys from us. In other words, we learn how often he made a purchase by choosing us.
<br>
**Monetary (Monetary Value)**: The total expenditure made by the customer. So it actually shows us the value of the customer, the more the spending, the more value :)
<br>


Let me first explain the data set variables I have:

InvoiceNo: Invoice number

StockCode:Unique product code

Description:Product name

Quantity: Product quantity (How many sold on the invoice)

InvoiceDate:Invoice date

CustomerID:Unique customer number

Country:Country name

I think this information about the project will be enough for us. I will proceed by explaining the other steps above the codes. You can find them from there.
